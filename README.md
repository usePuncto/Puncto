### Hybrid Pricing & Metered Billing Architecture

The platform uses a **hybrid pricing model**:

- **Standardized tiers:** Grátis (R$ 0), Starter (R$ 69,90), Growth (R$ 189,90), Pro (R$ 399,90), plus custom **Enterprise**.
- **Metered billing (Pay-As-You-Go):** Variable costs—**WhatsApp messages** and **fiscal notes (NFS-e/NFC-e)**—are tracked per business. Growth and Pro plans include monthly quotas (e.g. Growth: 150 msgs / 30 notes; Pro: 300 msgs / 100 notes). Usage above quota is billed automatically via **Stripe** (metered billing or usage-based reporting).
- **Implementation:** Subscription tier and quotas are stored in Firestore; usage is incremented on send/generation and reported to Stripe for overage charges. Same database and API support all tiers; tier + quotas drive entitlements and billing.

### Modality-Based Feature Flagging

- **Four business modalities:** Beauty, Health, Retail, Admin. All modalities share the **same subscription tiers and database structure**.
- **Onboarding:** The client selects a **modality** (profile) during onboarding; this is persisted (e.g. `modality` on the business document) and used for feature-flagging.
- **Frontend:** The admin UI **dynamically renders modality-specific modules** (e.g. KDS and Inventory for Retail; Electronic Health Records for Health; core scheduling for Beauty and Admin). Navigation and route guards use tier + modality to show/hide sections.
- **Backend:** API routes validate both subscription tier and modality so that only allowed modules are accessible (e.g. Retail-only endpoints for KDS, orders; Health-only for EHR).

## 🏗️ Multi-Instance Architecture

Puncto consists of **4 distinct instances** served from the same Next.js application using domain-based routing:

### 1. Institutional Website (`puncto.com.br`)
**Purpose:** Marketing and lead generation  
**Access:** Public (no authentication required)  
**Route:** `src/app/(marketing)/`  
**Domain:** `puncto.com.br`, `www.puncto.com.br`

**Features:**
- Landing pages and pricing information
- Feature showcases and industry-specific pages
- Blog, resources, support
- Lead capture forms

### 2. Platform Admin (`admin.puncto.com.br`)
**Purpose:** Puncto team internal dashboard  
**Access:** Platform administrators only  
**Route:** `src/app/platform/`  
**Domain:** `admin.puncto.com.br`

**Features:**
- View/manage all businesses
- View/manage all users
- Subscription and billing oversight
- Support ticket management
- Platform analytics and metrics
- Feature flag management
- Business onboarding/offboarding
- System configuration

### 3. Client Admin Dashboard (`{business-slug}.puncto.com.br/admin`)
**Purpose:** Business owners/managers manage their operations  
**Access:** Authenticated business staff (owner, manager, professional)  
**Route:** `src/app/tenant/admin/`

### Routing Logic

The middleware (`middleware.ts`) handles subdomain-based routing:

```typescript
// Extract subdomain from hostname and route accordingly:
if (subdomain === 'admin') → /platform/* (Platform admin)
if (no subdomain || subdomain === 'www') → /(marketing)/* (Institutional site)
if (subdomain === '{business-slug}') → /tenant/* (Client instance)
```

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Separate Authentication Flows

Puncto implements **three completely separate authentication flows** to prevent unauthorized access and ensure security:

#### 1. Platform Admin (Internal Team Only)
- **Access:** Manual creation via script only
- **Login:** `/auth/platform/login`
- **Features:** Full platform access, manage all businesses, subscription oversight

**Creating Platform Admin:**
```bash
npm run create-admin
```
Interactive prompts will guide you through creating a platform administrator with the appropriate access level (super_admin, support, or analyst).

**For existing users, grant admin access:**
```bash
npm run set-admin email@puncto.com.br
```
**Note:** Users must sign out and sign in again after the claim is set for it to take effect.

#### 2. Business Owner (Self-Service)
- **Signup:** `/auth/business/signup`
- **Login:** `/auth/business/login`
- **Flow:** Signup → Business Onboarding → Plan Selection → Payment → Auto-assignment

**Automatic Role Assignment:**
When a business owner completes the onboarding and payment process, the system automatically:
- Assigns `userType: 'business_user'`
- Grants `businessRoles[businessId]: 'owner'`
- Sets `primaryBusinessId: businessId`
- Creates business with selected subscription tier

**No manual intervention required** - business owners are fully self-service.

#### 3. Customer (Self-Service)
- **Signup:** `/auth/customer/signup`
- **Login:** `/auth/customer/login`
- **Flow:** Quick signup → Immediate access (no onboarding)

**Automatic Assignment:**
- Assigns `userType: 'customer'`
- Grants access to booking history and profile
- No business admin access

### User Types & Custom Claims

| User Type | Custom Claims | Access Level |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Platform Admin** | `userType: 'platform_admin'`<br>`platformAdmin: true`<br>`platformRole: 'super_admin' \| 'support' \| 'analyst'` | Full platform access |
| **Business Owner** | `userType: 'business_user'`<br>`businessRoles: {businessId: 'owner'}`<br>`primaryBusinessId: businessId` | Full access to their business(es) |
| **Business Manager** | `userType: 'business_user'`<br>`businessRoles: {businessId: 'manager'}` | Limited admin access (configurable) |
| **Professional** | `userType: 'business_user'`<br>`businessRoles: {businessId: 'professional'}` | Read-only, manage own bookings |
| **Customer** | `userType: 'customer'`<br>`customerId: userId` | Own bookings and profile only |

### Security Enforcement

**Multi-Layer Protection:**
1. **Middleware** - Validates JWT custom claims before page load
2. **Layout Components** - `<ProtectedRoute>` enforces role requirements
3. **API Routes** - Server-side validation on all endpoints

**Access Control Rules:**
- ❌ Customers **cannot** access business admin areas
- ❌ Business owners **cannot** access platform admin areas
- ❌ Business owners **cannot** access other businesses' admin areas
- ✅ Platform admins have full access when needed
- ✅ All access attempts are logged and monitored

### Authentication URLs

| User Type | Signup | Login | Dashboard |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Platform Admin** | Manual script | `/auth/platform/login` | `/platform/dashboard` |
| **Business Owner** | `/auth/business/signup` | `/auth/business/login` | `/{slug}/admin/dashboard` |
| **Customer** | `/auth/customer/signup` | `/auth/customer/login` | `/my-bookings` |

**Development Access:**
- Platform Admin: `http://localhost:3000?subdomain=admin`
- Business: `http://localhost:3000?subdomain={slug}`
- Customer: `http://localhost:3000?subdomain={slug}`

**Production Access:**
- Platform Admin: `https://admin.puncto.com.br`
- Business: `https://{slug}.puncto.com.br`
- Customer: `https://{slug}.puncto.com.br`

## 🎯 Feature Access Control

Features are controlled by **two dimensions**:

### 1. Subscription Tier (Hybrid Pricing Model)

Four standardized tiers plus custom Enterprise:

| Tier | Price (BRL/month) | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Grátis** | R$ 0 | Limited features, entry-level |
| **Starter** | R$ 69,90 | Core scheduling and confirmations |
| **Growth** | R$ 189,90 | Scheduling + payments + restaurant/retail modules; includes metered quotas (see below) |
| **Pro** | R$ 399,90 | Full feature set; higher metered quotas |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | All features, custom limits, white-label, dedicated support |

All tiers share the same database structure; tier controls which features and quotas apply.

### 2. Business Modality (Feature-Flagging by Profile)

The system supports **four business modalities**. The same subscription tiers and database schema apply to all; the **frontend dynamically renders modality-specific modules** based on the profile selected during onboarding.

```typescript
type BusinessModality = 
  | 'beauty'   // Beauty salons, barbershops, aesthetics
  | 'health'   // Clinics, medical/dental, EHR-focused
  | 'retail'   // Restaurants, cafes, commerce; KDS, inventory
  | 'admin';  // Corporate/admin, general operations
```

**Modality-based module visibility (examples):**

| Modality | Dynamically Rendered Modules | Notes |
|----------|------------------------------|-------|
| **Beauty** | Scheduling, services, professionals, CRM, payments | Core agenda and client management |
| **Health** | Scheduling, Electronic Health Records (EHR), patients, compliance | Health-specific workflows and records |
| **Retail** | KDS (Kitchen Display System), digital menu, table ordering, inventory, orders | Restaurant/commerce operations |
| **Admin** | Scheduling, time clock, financial reports, dashboards | General back-office and management |

- **Backend:** Single API and data model; feature access validated by tier + modality.
- **Frontend:** Navigation and module visibility (e.g. KDS, Inventory for Retail; EHR for Health) are driven by the client's **modality** chosen at onboarding.

### Using Feature Guards

**In Client Components:**
```tsx
import { FeatureGuard } from '@/components/features/FeatureGuard';

export default function MenuPage() {
  return (
    <FeatureGuard feature="restaurantMenu">
      <RestaurantMenu />
    </FeatureGuard>
  );
}
```

**Using Hook:**
```tsx
import { useFeatureAccess } from '@/lib/hooks/useFeatureAccess';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const hasMenu = useFeatureAccess('restaurantMenu');
  
  if (!hasMenu) {
    return <UpgradePrompt />;
  }
  
  return <RestaurantMenu />;
}
```

### API Feature Validation

All API routes validate feature access server-side:

```typescript
// Example: Restaurant menu endpoint
const featureCheck = await verifyBusinessFeatureAccess(businessId, 'restaurantMenu');
if (!featureCheck?.hasAccess) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Feature not available', message: '...' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

**Security Guarantee:**
- ❌ A Beauty-modality business **CANNOT** access Retail-only endpoints (e.g. KDS, table ordering) (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Server-side validation by tier + modality prevents bypass via Postman or direct API calls

---

## 💳 Onboarding & Payment Flow

### Mandatory Payment Onboarding

## 🔐 Security

### Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Helper functions
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    function belongsToBusiness(businessId) {
      return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.token.businessId == businessId;
    }
    
    function hasRole(role) {
      return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.token.role == role;
    }
    
    // Organizations
    match /businesses/{businessId} {
      allow read: if belongsToBusiness(businessId);
      allow write: if belongsToBusiness(businessId) && hasRole('owner');
      
      // Subcollections
      match /bookings/{bookingId} {
        allow read: if belongsToBusiness(businessId);
        allow create: if true;  // Public can book
        allow update, delete: if belongsToBusiness(businessId) && 
          (hasRole('owner') || hasRole('manager'));
      }
      
      match /customers/{customerId} {
        allow read, write: if belongsToBusiness(businessId);
      }
      
      match /orders/{orderId} {
        allow read: if belongsToBusiness(businessId);
        allow create, update: if true;  // Public can order
      }
      
      // Other subcollections follow similar patterns
    }
    
    // Users
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if isAuthenticated() && 
        (request.auth.uid == userId || hasRole('owner') || hasRole('manager'));
      allow write: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Firebase Auth** with custom claims for RBAC
- **JWT tokens** with `businessId` and `role` claims
- **Platform Admin** - Custom claim `platformAdmin: true` for Puncto team access
  - Access via `npm run set-admin email@puncto.com.br`
  - Must sign out and sign in after claim is set
  - Full access to all businesses and users
- **MFA** for owners and managers
- **Secure sessions** with httpOnly cookies + JWT
- **API key rotation** for third-party integrations

### API Feature Validation

All API routes validate feature access server-side using business type and subscription tier:

```typescript
// Server-side validation in API routes
const featureCheck = await verifyBusinessFeatureAccess(businessId, 'restaurantMenu');
if (!featureCheck?.hasAccess) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Feature not available', message: '...' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

**Protected Endpoints:**
- `/api/menu` - Validates `restaurantMenu` feature (Retail modality)
- `/api/orders` - Validates `tableOrdering` feature (Retail modality)
- `/api/platform/*` - Validates platform admin access

**Security Guarantee:**
- ❌ Beauty-modality businesses cannot access Retail-only endpoints (403 Forbidden)
- ❌ Cannot be bypassed via Postman or direct API calls
- ✅ Server-side validation prevents unauthorized access

### Data Privacy (LGPD/GDPR)

- Data minimization by design
- Pseudonymization in analytics
- Configurable retention periods
- Data export capabilities (CSV/JSON)
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Consent management with audit logs
- Designated DPO (Data Protection Officer)

### Metered Billing (Pay-As-You-Go)

Variable costs are billed via **metered usage** through Stripe. Growth and Pro plans include **monthly quotas**; usage above the quota is billed automatically.

| Metered Item | Growth (included/month) | Pro (included/month) | Excess Billing |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **WhatsApp messages** | 150 | 300 | Per message above quota (Stripe metered) |
| **Fiscal notes (NFS-e/NFC-e)** | 30 | 100 | Per note above quota (Stripe metered) |

- **Architecture:** Usage is tracked server-side; Stripe Metered Billing (or usage-based reporting) is used to charge for excess WhatsApp messages and fiscal notes.
- **Grátis / Starter:** No included quotas for metered items; upgrades or add-ons apply as defined.
- **Enterprise:** Quotas and overage terms are custom per contract.
